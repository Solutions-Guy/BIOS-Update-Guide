For multi-node systems, manually updating the BIOS of all nodes can take a considerable amount of time. Redfish APIs can help automate and streamline the BIOS update process. 
This document provides instructions on how to update the BIOS with a compatible image through Redfish methods on X11 BigTwin systems. This method is compatible with BMC version 1.71.xx. 
Redfish is a standard that uses RESTful interface semantics to access a schema based data model to conduct management operations. For more information about Supermicro Redfish support, please visit this link
